# Project Summary

During this project, we'll be building a web application that walks users through filling out a home loan application. We'll be building out the components that have already been made and make them better with redux. To keep track of data and pass it to the correct components we'll make heavy use of Redux and React Redux. We'll be making changes to all files in the components folder except for Finish.js to help them work with Redux, as well as the router, a store, reducer

1) run the following in your terminal `npm i redux react-redux react-router-dom --save`
